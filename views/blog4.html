      <p>When you see the final result of a mobile detail — glossy paint, spotless wheels, a fresh-smelling interior — it's easy to think it's just about "washing a car."</p>
      
      <p><strong>The truth?</strong> Mobile detailing is physically demanding, skill-based work that takes focus, precision, and hustle.</p>

      <p>Here's what goes into every job at GrandVista Mobile Detailing.</p>

      <h3>1. Early Starts, All-Weather Conditions</h3>
      <p>We work when it's hot enough to bake the pavement or cold enough to freeze your fingertips. Summer heat, winter wind, unexpected rain — the job doesn't stop.</p>
      <div class="work-facts">
        <p>Mobile detailing means adapting to every condition to get the job done right.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>2. Physical Endurance</h3>
      <p>Detailers are on their feet for hours at a time, constantly bending, kneeling, scrubbing, and reaching into tight spaces.</p>
      <div class="work-facts">
        <p>It's like a full-body workout — except instead of sets and reps, we're working toward a showroom shine.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>3. Attention to Every Inch</h3>
      <p>Your average car has hundreds of surfaces that collect dirt, dust, and grime — from door jambs and seat rails to dashboard vents and cup holders.</p>
      <p><strong>Detailers clean all of it</strong>, often with tools small enough to fit into gaps the size of a coin.</p>

      <h3>4. Heavy, Specialized Equipment</h3>
      <p>We haul and operate powerful vacuums, steamers, polishers, and pressure washers — plus water tanks and generators for jobs that require them.</p>
      <p><strong>Every piece of gear is maintained and cleaned</strong> so it works flawlessly on the next car.</p>

      <h3>5. Working Against the Clock (But Never Cutting Corners)</h3>
      <p>We balance quality with efficiency. Every job has to be perfect, but customers also rely on us to finish within a set time.</p>
      <div class="work-facts">
        <p>That means working fast while staying meticulous — a skill that comes only with experience.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>6. Pride in the Transformation</h3>
      <p>The most rewarding part? Seeing the customer's reaction when they step into their "new" car.</p>
      <p><strong>That moment makes the sweat, sore muscles, and long hours worth it.</strong></p>

      <div class="highlight-box" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
        <h3>🚗 Why This Matters for Customers</h3>
        <p>When you book a mobile detail, you're not just paying for "cleaning" — you're investing in the skill, strength, and dedication it takes to do the job right.</p>
        <p><strong>At GrandVista Mobile Detailing, we put our all into every single car because your ride deserves nothing less.</strong></p>
