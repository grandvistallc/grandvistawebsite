ICO generation was not available in this environment.
You still have the required PNG sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48.
To generate favicon.ico locally:
- On macOS/Linux with ImageMagick: convert favicon-16x16.png favicon-32x32.png favicon-48x48.png favicon.ico
- Or use any offline/online converter to combine those three into favicon.ico.
